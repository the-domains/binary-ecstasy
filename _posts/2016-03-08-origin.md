# origin.

For a guy who'd only been out of his hometown a few times, my life sure has changed much in the last 9 months. I started working for a startup, dropped out of school, moved to Austin, moved to San Francisco, moved to Berlin, spent a month in Thailand, vacationed in Hong Kong and finally came back "home" to Berlin.

It may sound like a pretty good time; and it has been. Dropping out of school may be the best decision I've made thus far in my life but it didn't come without its hardships.

My life revolves mostly around music, tech, gaming and learning. Follow along to read about my experiences, adventures, tech, advice, and who knows what else.a
